<div> <p>If you have a home cleaner year round, it is probably not necessary to tip each time.  Instead, you can give a cash bonus or gift at the end of the year. This is very common for year round cleaners, even if you hire them directly.This is a nice way to show your appreciation and make the house cleaner feel good about his or her service. Again, it is always up to you whether you want to give some cash or gift to the maid or not.</p><p>Start by searching online to find the best home cleaning services in your area. After finding potential candidates:</p><p>A private cleaner charges 20% to 50% less than a professional cleaning service, has more scheduling flexibility, and may negotiate rates. However, individual home cleaners are not usually licensed or insured. A house cleaning company has set prices, may require a contract, and may send a different cleaner to your home each time.</p></div>

<div><p>Finally, it’s important to remember that tipping is just one way to show appreciation for a job well done. You can also express your gratitude with a thank-you note or positive review on the cleaning company’s website or social media channels. Ultimately, the most important thing is to communicate your satisfaction or concerns to the cleaning company or individual, so they have the opportunity to improve their services and ensure that you’re happy with the results.</p><p>It’s essentially cleaning the house from top to bottom. That includes cleaning all the surfaces, each appliance inside and out, removing built-up muck and grease, and cleaning all floors. It’s the full cleaning service. A thorough end of tenancy clean can make such a big difference to the finished look of a rented property. Especially when it comes to cleaning places that have often been neglected or forgotten about during a standard spring clean.</p><p>In this guide, we are going to review etiquette for tipping your help around the house.  There are different schools of thought here, so the answer is "It Depends".</p></div>
